# Before We Start


# 1.2

What are the contents of the course?
The course contains these topics like 
- Arrays
- Matrices
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queues
- Trees
- Graph
- Hashing
- Recursion and Sorting.

what are data structures?
- program is a set of instructions which performs operations on data. So without data, instructions cannot be performed. So data is an important part of a program. So when a program is dealing with the data, how it will organize the data in the main memory, that's what its data structures, the way you organize the data in the main memory during execution time of a program that is data structure.

- if you see the components of a computer system, a CPU which executes the program. So how you keep the data in main memory so that it can be best utilized by the program, efficiently utilized by the program. So that arrangement of data is data structure.

- So depending on the requirements of the program, the type of procedures it is performing, we have various data structures. So depending on your requirements, you can choose a suitable data structure.

what are the list of data structures?
So here I have the list of data structures.
- physical data structures define how the data is arranged in memory.
    Arrays
    Matrices
    Linked List
- logical data structures defines how the data can be utilized, how the arrangement is and how it should be utilized.
    stack
    queue
    Trees
    Graph
    Hash Table

If you take physically data structures like Arrays and the Matrices these are provided by almost every programming language like C, C++, Java, in every language you have a built in Arrays. There's a part of a compiler only directly you can declare an array like this and you can start using it. In C language, you can declare an array of single dimensionality like this or a two dimensional array of some size for implementing matrices. So this is built in as a part of compiler, now the linked list is not there in C language, so we have to create it.

Why one should study data structures, see data structures, the core subject for programmers or I.T. professionals?

- So for computer science graduates, undergraduates who are pursuing the course engineering course, they have this as a subject. So they have to study as a part of academics.
- And the second thing in the industry, if you're working as a programmer, then you have to use data structures in your application development. So without data structures, you cannot develop applications at all. So you should have good understanding of data structures.

Now next question, which programming languages is suitable for data structures?

You can select any language, whichever language you know, you can select that language.

Then next question, do I have to develop these data structures?

Right.

Create them by myself in every programming language, No all these languages.

They have their built in data structures available, so these languages, provide something or

the other or some languages, provide everything built in available so they have the things available

already.

So just you have to use them and you don't have to develop your own data structure.

You have to use them for using them.

You should know how they work and where to use them.

So the level one knowledge is sufficient.

All these languages provide stability data structures like in C++ there are STLS and in Java there

are collection classes right in C Sharp.

Also collection classes are there in Python, also containers are there and in JavaScript also collections

are there or DOM objects are also there in JavaScript.

So languages have a built in data structure.

So mostly people study about those data structures and they want to understand how to use them, just

how they work and how to use them.

That is sufficient for most of the people.

But this course goes way beyond them that one.

If you want to learn about these, these are language specific.

So if you are studying about the language, you can learn about them, then what about the C language,

C languages, not having building data structures, if you are.

If you want any one of these data structures, then you should develop your own code.

Next question.

Which language is used in this course?

See C language is not having built in data structures.

So I have used that language for creating or implementing these data structures and also I have given sufficient

idea for using C++.

Even if you want to implement Java and C Sharp, you can do that.

That's your choice and that will be your responsibility.

How to implement this code in C Sharp or Java.

I'll be showing in C and that is also same.

And C++ also whatever I'm showing in C that is nothing but C++ also because C is a subset of C++

right.

So it is combined.

I said C and C++.

Right.

But a C++ is having some object oriented features.

So how to use those features.

I have discussed that.

So whatever is done in C language, you can easily convert into C++.

If you know C++, if you don't know C++, then you will not be able to do it.

Then next question why I have selected C language.

Why not any other language?

See When you are understanding the operations on these data structures in detail and you are observing

them very closely, then C is a suitable language for doing programming on that.

So for every operation we write functions that are procedures, we write procedures, so the procedures

and the functions are available in every language.

They are available, in every language, C, C++, Java, everywhere.

Only the difference is in C++ and Java.

We put them inside class in C they are open.

That's it.

They are global functions, but they are member functions in Java and C++.

So I have you C language?

Because I am showing you how to implement the operations alright and as C is not having anything built in and

it's most suitable and most perfect language for learning data structures.

The another reason is other languages are already having their own building data structures.

Then why do you make your own so C is not having its so you make its your own.

So that will help you understand all these.

Also, if you know a little bit about the language, you can understand them easily.

Then the next question, how the course contents are organized.

Since in the beginning section, I have discussed the required features of C and C++ that are used in the

course.

So you should be knowing C C++ and if you brush up these concepts, then you can start with the course.

I have not directly started with the course for brush up.

I have some section, so I have brush up the concept of C and C++ like structures functions, classes, templates,

parameter passing that are useful for programming in this course implementing these data structures.

The next question, sorting.

Are covered in this course.

Yes, almost all the sorting techniques are covered here and there.

Implementation also shown in this one, like bubbles sort selection sort insertion sort various sorting

are shown here.

So sorting is covered in depth.

And the analysis also done in depth than the last and the important question is recursion , I have

a first section as recursion right before starting these data structures.

I have used recursion, first is recursion.

Why?

What is the importance?

So see, recursion is a difficult topic for the students.

Mostly students struggle in understanding it.

So I have covered it to make it simple.

And you have the good understanding of recursion and most of the operations that are implemented on

these data structures are basically defining recursion and they are also implemented without recursion

using loops.

Also, then the next thing recursion is usually felt as inefficient because it uses stack internally.

It is not much useful for solving large size problems.

Then still we study recursion.

What is the reason?

So there is something called problem solving and programming.

So these two are two different things.

Problem solving is a different programming is different mostly student try to mix them.

The thing that if they understand programming, they learn problem solving, no problem solving is different

and programming is different.

So programming can be learned in just a few days.

But problem solving is a lifetime.

Work programming means the syntax, languages, anyone of the language.

If you know the features that are sufficient, then problem solving.

You should be good at mathematics than if you're solving a problem.

Solution you will be giving in mathematics and mathematics.

Have recursion, mathematics.

Doesn't have Loops mathematics have recursion.

So your solution will be mostly in the form of recursion.

So every programming language supports recursion, no doubt it is less used, but it supports in case

if you're writing a recursive function, you can write it.

Otherwise as a programmer, you can learn how to convert a recursion into a loop.

So mostly problems are solved in recursion, then they are converted into a loop.

So understanding the recursion is a very important thing for understanding problem solving.

So that's all.

These are the questions.

And one more thing students believe that the topic is data structures and algorithm algorithms.

Are those algorithms that are used on this data structure algorithm is a very vast topic, even Google

and Facebook uses algorithms.

So Algorithms doesn't mean that I'll be teaching Google's algorithm or face recognition algorithm or

vehicle tracking algorithm for everything.

Algorithms are the algorithm is a separate subject for that.

There is a YouTube channel.

You can search for algorithm and YouTube and you can find my lot of free videos.

So I cannot include those free videos here.

So if you are studying want to study algorithm, you can watch YouTube, channel separate as a subject mostly

for academics this courses about data structures and algorithms that are applied on data structures that's

all in this video.

And the next video is up on the essential features of C and C++ that you need for completing.

This course or following this course.

If you're familiar with that, you can skip and you can.

Start with the next section, That's all.
