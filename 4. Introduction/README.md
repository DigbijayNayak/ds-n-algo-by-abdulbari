# 39. Introduction

Introduction to data structures.

- Data is an integral part of our applications or programs. If I define a program, program is nothing but set of instructions which perform operations on data to get some results. So without data there is no need of instruction, no use of instructions, then the data term, term data, We use it in many places like Data Structures, databases, data warehouse, big data.

What is actually data structure?

- what is data structure. Data structure can be defined as arrangement of collection of data items so that they can be utilized efficiently, operations on that data can be done efficiently. So it's all about the arrangement of data and the operations on the data that are efficient operations on the data. But the question is, Where? Inside the main memory during the execution of a program. So without data structure there cannot be any application. Every application will have a set of instructions which will perform operations on data, so data is mandatory, then where the data is kept? inside the main memory. Where the programs will be? inside the main memory. So during the execution of a program how the program will manage data inside the main memory and perform the operations. That is data structure.

add diagram here.

Let us look at this diagram. Here is a CPU, processor that is central processing unit that is our microprocessor. And this is main memory. Let us say this is a RAM; and this is a storage that is hard disk drive or external storage or just we call it as storage.

- a program has to be brought into the main memory for its execution, as well as data has to be brought into the main memory for processing on the data, so that these instructions can perform operation on the data. Program can not directly process the data keeping it on the storage, The data has to be brought into the main memory.

- Now, from this we can say that every application deals with some data, whether it is MS word or if it is NotePad, then the NotePad file, text file has to be brought into the main memory; if it is chrome, you are browsing any web page, then that page, when it is coming from internet, It has to be in the main memory. So every application on your computer system or any mobile phone deals with some data, and that data has to be inside main memory. How you organize data inside the main memory, Such that it can be easily used by this application efficiently, utilized by this application program?

- So how you organize the data? So the arrangement or organizing of the data inside the main memory for efficient utilization by the application that arrangement is called as a Data Structure. So data structures are formed in the main memory, during the execution time of a program.

- When the program runs it needs the data. So the question how it will arrange the data in the main memory for performing its operations. So that arrangement is called as data structures. So a data structure is a part of running program. You may be knowing different data structures, like arrays or linked lists or trees or hash tables, whatever the data structure is suitable, application can use that particular data structure here for arranging its data. Data may be a text data, or a multi media data like images or videos, Lot of contents maybe there, in the form of data; so all those contents, how they are organized in the main memory.

- So we have to design some data structure so that the application can use it perfectly or more efficiently and application should work faster or process faster over that data. So that's it.

What is databases?

- when the data is larger in size, or commercial data that is used in businesses, like banks or retail stores or manufacturing farms, they will have a lot of data, and they will have some organized data in the form of database tables or relational data, and where they keep that relational data, all that data is stored on the disk.
- Data maybe spread out across various database tables and is organized in the form of tables and the tables are having a relationship between them. So mostly, commercial data is stored in the form of data tables.

- if any application program is using that database then data has to be brought into the main memory, Then only you can use it. So again you need data structure here. When you are pulling the data from the hard disk or from the storage to the main memory during execution then you need definitely data structure here. So arrangement of data here in the main memory is data structure,

- Then how this data is organized in form of table on the disk, This is database. A database means arranging the data in some model like say a relational model in the permanent storage, so that it can be retrieved or to accessed by applications easily, That arrangement in the hard disk, or in the permanent storage, It's called as database.

- The data used in businesses, so they will have a huge amount of data daily coming in, Like many customers are making transactions or lot of goods are manufactured and sold. So the data size will be growing day by day large and large. So large sized data, or very large data, that may not be used daily, right? Like 1 year old data, or 10 year old data, that may not be used now.

- So commercial data can be categorized into 2, that is operational data or legacy data, old data. Operational data that is used daily, and Legacy data can be kept as storage somewhere, if required we can fetch that data and use it, or you can say historical data. So, that historical data can be kept on array of disk, because just imagine 10 years of data, or 50 years of data, is kept on, not just one disk, an array of disk. So the large size data which is kept here that is acting as a historical data for any commercial form, This is data warehouse. So mostly commercial farms will have their Data warehouses.

- That data warehouse is helpful for analyzing the business, or making the policies, or starting a new trend, or giving offers to the customers, dealing with the customers, so for that, the previous data, old data will help in organization and taking decisions. So, this large size data is data warehouse, and the algorithms written for analyzing that data are data mining algorithms.

- Big Data. With the start of internet, a huge sized data is accumulating, day by day in Internet, that data is about things, about people, about places, lot of data is available in the Internet. And by analyzing that data we can take a lot of decisions, that is for management, for governance, or for businesses. Analysis is very useful about that data. Storing and utilizing that very large sized data, that study is Big Data. That study is Big Data.

- Data Structure is in main memory, during the execution of a program, arrangement of data here. And arrangement of data on the disk is Database; Arrangement of data in the array of disk is Data Warehouse. That is not operational, That is not used day to day. And, the Big Data, that is used in Internet.
